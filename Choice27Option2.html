		<p>Well would you look at that… Maybe the Gods are with us.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Theres a minivan parked in a clearing on the road.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Theres nobody in the front, and I certainly don’t see anyone around.</p>
		<br>
		<p>If I thought they’d be back anytime soon I might wait and ask to hitch a ride, but I'm not sure where they could be or how long that could take.</p>
		<br>
		<p>I could… try hotwiring the van?</p>
		<br>
		<p>It would be fast and I'm kind of in a hurry; it would save me some energy too.</p>
		<br>
		<p>It’s not really the “right” thing to do, but what is right really?</p>
