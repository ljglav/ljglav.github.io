		<p>It doesn’t really work like that, there aren’t spells for anything and everything.</p>
		<br>
		<p>I can't just magic a cooked chicken or a tent in front of myself.</p>
		<br>
		<p>I would need to already have the item, then use magic to build the tent or something like that.</p>
		<br>
		<p>But it’s really not worth it, my magic isn’t “free” to cast, it can be extremely tiring.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Like right now, I haven’t eaten in almost two days and it takes constant effort for me to keep this channel open. In this state, I wouldn’t be able to cast another spell simultaneously.</p>
