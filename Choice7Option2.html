		<a class="choicemade">Nice to meet you, but why are we talking? What's going on with you right now?</a>
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p>Oh… Yeah… Back to that. 
		<br>
		<p>Well, let me just give you the CliffsNotes of what's going on with me:</p>
		<br>
		<p>About two years ago I watched my parents die in front of me.</p>
		<br>
		<p>They were on the council of the of the all-wizard town we lived in at the time. Six years ago there were reports of Dark Magic use in the town, then a murder.</p>
		<br>
		<p>The three teenagers held responsible were put in front of the council and were voted to be banished from the town.</p>
		<br>
		<p>They held my parents responsible for the banishment because they campaigned other members of the council against the three.</p>
		<br>
		<p>After four years, the three came back to our town. Their leader, Azazel – the one who actually committed the murder that got them all excommunicated – killed my parents.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Mara, who enjoys the evil of it all, she’s the meanest of the three, she held me in a suspended state with a spell, forcing me to watch.</p>
		<br>
		<p>In the other room, Samuel, the most “innocent” of the three; An orphan himself, was said to have been taken in by Azazel and Mara, who changed him as person and made him one of them… He kidnapped by brother.</p>
		<br>
		<p>So here I am. I left the town not long after, I couldn’t stay in that house, but I also left to find Azazel, Mara and Samuel and my brother; To save the only family I have left.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Fun times, huh?</p>
		<br>
		<p>My life before that was going pretty well, then it turns tragic, has a lot of tragic stuff in the middle… well, were not at the end yet, but it’s looking to be pretty tragic as well.</p>
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<a class="choicebtn" href="Choice7.1Option1.html">Is there anything I<br>can do to make your<br>life less tragic?</a>
		<a class="choicebtn" href="Choice8Option2Rejoin.html">You haven’t seen your<br>brother since?</a>
