		<p>I'm walking through a wooded area.</p>
		<br>
		<p>I'm enjoying our chat, but I do have things to be doing as well.</p>
		<br>
		<p>My brother is potentially waiting for me to find him and has been for two years!</p>
		<br>
		<p>I’m the closest I have ever been to finding Alexander, I have been following endless leads and hitting infinite dead-ends since the day I lost him, but I think I finally think I know where Azazel, Mara and Samuel have been all this time.</p>
		<br>
		<p>And I'm on my way there.</p>
		<br>
		<p>It’s a long way from my hometown, but I'm coming up on little village right now and they shouldn’t be far from here.</p>
		<br>
		<p>In relation to the distance I've covered since the start of all this, that is.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Hopefully I can find something to eat here, I can't lose my only chance to get Alexander back because I was running on an empty stomach.</p>
